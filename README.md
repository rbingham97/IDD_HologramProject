IDD Final Project - Desktop Hologram

This is the repo for my final IDD project. I'm away from home currently, but I'll post photos of parts and progress in the next few days. 

This project is to construct a desktop hologram using the Pepper's Ghost optical illusion. The device will use a RaspberryPi connected to a 7.0" TFT display to display an image, which will be reflected by a thin plastic reflector screen (angled at 45 degrees) to make the image appear is if it is floating behind the reflector. The device will have a voice recognition intercom to control key functions, and a stretch goal is to integrate a camera to track the viewer's face and change the displayed image according to their viewing angle. This stretch goal would improve the quality of the illusion significantly. 

I have already ordered all the parts (except the face tracking camera), and the links are below:
